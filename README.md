manifolds**](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.20.457160)

Recently, it was shown that both the normal states and their respective tumors span disjoint manifolds in gene expression space. By processing gene expression data we show that, in general, for the vectors defining the centers of cloud samples:

1. The closest tumor to a given normal state is its respective tumor,
2. Two normal states define quasi-orthogonal directions,
3. A tumor may have a projection onto its corresponding normal state, but it is quasi-orthogonal to all others and
4. The cancer manifold is roughly obtained by translating the normal tissue manifold along an orthogonal direction defined by the cancer projection axis.
